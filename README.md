Machine learning applications can potentially improve the accuracy of treatment protocols and health outcomes through algorithmic processes.

For example, deep learning, a type of complex machine learning that mimics how the human brain functions, is increasingly being used in radiology and medical imaging. Using neural networks that can learn from data without any supervision, deep learning applications can detect, recognize and analyze cancerous lesions from images.

Faster processing speeds and cloud infrastructures allow machine learning applications to detect anomalies in images beyond what the human eye can see, aiding in diagnosing and treating disease.

Future advancements in machine learning in healthcare will continue to transform the industry. Machine learning applications under development include a diagnostic tool for diabetic retinopathy and predictive analytics to determine breast cancer recurrence based on medical records and images.
